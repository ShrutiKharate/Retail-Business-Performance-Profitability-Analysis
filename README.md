## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Used

* **File:** `Retail_with_categories.csv`
* Contains transactional records including:

  * Product Name, Product Category
  * Transaction ID, Date
  * Total Items, Total Cost, Profit
  * Store Type, City, Season, Payment Method

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

* **SQL (MySQL Workbench)** â€“ Data cleaning, aggregation, view creation
* **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)** â€“ Advanced analysis & visualization
* **Power BI** â€“ Interactive dashboard for business insights
* **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Python workflow and correlation analysis

---

## ðŸ“Š SQL Analysis Performed

* Cleaned null/missing records
* Created views to map `Product_Category` into logical `Category` and `Sub_Category`
* Aggregated:

  * Total Profit and Total Sales by `Category` and `Sub_Category`
  * Profit Margin calculation
* Extracted distinct product segments for visualization

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Python Data Analysis Highlights

* Calculated and visualized:

  * Correlation between Inventory Days and Profitability
  * Profit by Category and Sub-Category
  * Basket size analysis and item movement
* Identified:

  * Slow-moving products based on low quantities
  * Overstocked items using high `Inventory_Days`
* Segmented seasonal performance & store type patterns

---

## ðŸ“‰ Power BI Dashboard Insights

* Filters: Region, Product Type, and Season
* Visuals:

  * KPIs: Total Sales, Profit, Profit Margin
  * Sales by Category and Season
  * Profit by Sub-Category
  * Scatterplot of Basket Size vs Items
  * Table of Slow-Moving Inventory
* Strategic Recommendations:

  * Promote high-profit items
  * Optimize inventory for seasonal trends
  * Address low-movement products

## âœ… Outcomes

* Actionable insights for business strategy
* Inventory and profitability optimization
* Strong foundation for further predictive modeling or clustering
